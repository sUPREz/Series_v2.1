  <Overview>Cassie Blake is a beautiful and shy, sixteen-year-old girl who moves to New Salem with her mother, to look after her sick grandmother. After being enrolled into a local high school, Cassie meets Diana Meade, a genuine and kind-hearted student who welcomes Cassie to her new school. Cassie also meets Diana's sadistic cousin, Faye Chamberlain, who promptly begins to ridicule and taunt her, all the while taking pleasure in causing Cassie pain.

After Diana introduces Cassie to other members of the circle, they reveal themselves as witches, and that she is one as well. Initially, Cassie refuses to believe them - until Adam shows her how to unlock her magical powers. After Cassie reluctantly joins the circle, Adam, Diana, Faye, and the other members of the coven quickly discover that with Cassie in their circle, they are able to cast spells more powerful than they ever could before.</Overview>

  <Overview>Cassie Blake's world is turned upside down after her mother dies in a mysterious accident, forcing Cassie to move in with her loving grandmother Jane in the small town of Chance Harbor, Washington. While trying to adjust to her new life, Cassie is quickly befriended by Diana Meade, a sweet-natured classmate who offers to show her around and introduces her to mean-girl Faye, her sidekick Melissa and Cassie's next door neighbor Nick. Things get complicated when she meets Adam, Diana's boyfriend, with whom she feels an instant and powerful connection. Upon meeting one of her mother's childhood friends, Dawn Chamberlain, the school principal and Faye's mother, Cassie begins to wonder why her mother never spoke of her hometown. When strange and dangerous things begin to happen, Cassie's new friends are forced to tell her their secret - they are all witches and her arrival will complete the Circle. However, the Circle has not been drawn together again by chance - Diana's father, Charles Meade has plans of his own for the group.</Overview>
