  <Overview>Will Schuester an optimistic high school teacher, tries to reinvent the McKinley High School's glee club, while reinventing himself. He challenges a group of outcasts to realize their true star potential, while facing harsh criticism from everyone in the school

Recap:

In the opening of the show, the cheerleaders are practicing while their coach is being quite the boot camp type. She tells them if they think they think that practice is hard, they should try to be waterboarded. Elsewhere, a bit of a hooptie has pulled into the lot. There we meet Will Schuester. He walks to the school and sees that the football players are about to throw a boy into the dumpster. That boy is Kurt. Will asks if he is making new friends and walks into the school fairly absentmindedly. He seems to be pretty oblivious. Finn saves Kurt's jacket when they throw him into the dumpster because it is new and high end. 

Will walks in and looks at the school's trophy case. There is a trophy from the year 1993 for Glee Club. Will frowns because he remembers his now deceased show choir coach. Elsewhere, there is a teacher named Sandy Ryerson in a music room. He is playing the piano while a male student sings a song from Oliver. They soon start dueting and then he touches the boy inappropriately. In the background, there is a girl that is watching what is going on.

Elsewhere, Will is talking to Ken--the football coach--about how they are out of coffee in the lounge. Sue comes in and has lattes. Emma then comes in and Ken tries to flirt with her but she's not into it. It seems that her heart goes a flutter whenever Will is around, though. Emma starts cleaning her table, because she is a germaphobe. She's a single woman who is looking for a relationship, but it isn't like she's really out there and actively looking. Emma tells Will about the Glee coach being fired and she wonders who will replace him. 

Will goes to Principal Figgins' office and finds himself taking the spot as the Glee coach. Unfortunately, it will be quite an investment as he's going to have to pay out of pocket and use what they already have for costumes. He decides to think it over and then makes the decision to do so. He posts up sign ups for Glee and Mercedes is the first to audition. Her audition song is Respect and amazed Will. The next person that auditions is Kurt and he is singing Mr. Cellophane. 

The next person to try out was a beautiful, alternative type of Asian girl. Her name is Tina and she stutters. She sings Katy Perry's &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;. After that, Rachel auditions and she sings a Les Mis song called &quot;I'm On My Own&quot;. She is the girl who called in Sandy and got him fired for what he did earlier. She thinks that she is going to become famous someday. She was raised by two gay dads and is slightly vindictive when she doesn't get what she wants. She pushes it as far as making a new video every day, but she also gets made fun of fiercely. Whether she is getting a slurpee in her face or getting verbally ripped apart by the cheerleaders. 

Artie has also joined Glee. Artie is a wheelchair bound guitarist who is a bit of a geek. Rachel thinks that they all suck, including herself. She feels down and considers leaving. Will has convinced her to do the opposite, however. She thinks that she has very limited time and needs a lead that will help her become more successful. 

Elsewhere, there is a woman that is high strung. She is at her job--Sheets 'N' Things--and she is yelling at a fellow worker and saying that he can't work there if he can't fold a sheet properly. Will shows up and then it comes clear that that woman his his wife Terri. He has brought her something to eat. She says something about mayonnaise causing her to &quot;have diabetes again&quot; and if she has it again, she won't be able to get pregnant.

Will begins to hear a man that is telling off a worker elsewhere in the store. It is Sandy, the teacher that just lost his job, and he has started selling medical marijuana. He is making much more money doing that. He has also been selling to the football coach. Will goes back to school and decides to talk to Sue about getting some of her girls interested in Glee so that Glee isn't just going to be treated like crap. They need a popularity boost.

Will talks to the football team and they basically scoff at the idea of joining Glee. He hears Finn singing a song and decides that he would be perfect for Glee. He decides to do something that is pretty sneaky by planting marijuana and blackmailing him so that he would join the club. He has decided that he will join and for the first song that he does it is with Rachel. They sing &quot;You're the One that I want&quot; together and that is when it is known that is going to stick with Glee because even Rachel wants him--and what the princess wants the princess gets. 

At home, Will and his wife are working on a puzzle. They begin arguing over her spending and she tells him that he should be making more money and he needs to let go of high school. At school, it seems that Emma is going to be chaperoning with Will for a competition. They need Finn, but there is some football related event. He decides to tell them that he needs to help her mom because she is getting her &quot;prostate removed&quot;. Ken is pretty upset right now because it is obvious that Will has stolen his football star. He is also jealous because he digs Emma and Emma digs Will. 

Rachel tells Finn that they probably expect them to be together since they'll be the lead. He tells her that he is dating cheerleader Quinn. She is also the president of celibacy club. Will and Emma are elsewhere talking about how he has been with his wife since high school and things aren't that great between them anymore. 

It is time for competition and they watch Vocal Adrenaline perform &quot;Rehab&quot;. They have thirty-six members and they are very well trained. Tina thinks that they are pretty much doomed. Elsewhere, Puck has told the guys that women don't have prostates and that Finn lied. Terri has told Will that she is pregnant and he thinks it is smarter for him to become an accountant instead. 

Elsewhere, Puck is making fun of Finn because of Glee and he tells him that he quit. Puck is happy about that and he has gotten him a present. It seems to be Artie, who is in a wheelchair, stuck in an outside bathroom. Instead of rolling the port a potty, he frees Artie and tells Puck that we are all losers and we should just deal with it. He also doesn't want to leave Glee or the football team. So, he's not going to.

Finn goes to Glee and apologizes. He tells them he wants to be a part of glee and they get it all worked out. Emma tries to convince Will not to quit and shows him a tape of when he was in nationals. He says it was the best time of his life but now he has to be responsible. She does convince him that he needs to do what he loves. When he goes back to the Glee room and sees that the kids are singing Journey's &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot; he decides to grab on and don't let go.

  <Overview>The Glee Club performs for the school for the first time. Meanwhile, when Quinn sees that Rachel has feelings for Finn, she goes to any length to keep him. Later, Mr. Schuester's wife reveals some surprising news. 

Recap:

The episode opens with Kurt being thrown into a dumpster by the football players. He tells them that one day they will all work for him. Emma and Will run into one another and he thanks her for being there for him and have a nice brief conversation. They are quite flirty, too.

Sue has beckoned Will and she tells him that she talked to Figgins. Figgins has said that if Glee doesn't get to regionals and do well they will no longer have a Glee club. She also tells him that they are going to need to have 12 people in Glee before they can even qualify. She tells him that maybe he should get the people from special education classes since no one else would in her mind. He asks if she is threatening him and she says that she isn't. She thinks that he wants to be like her and he is convinced that he can get the kids to win at regionals. 

The lovebirds--Finn and Quinn are having a bit of an argument. Quinn thinks that if he stays in Glee then they are going end up on the bottom of the totem pole. She also tells him that people are starting to believe that Finn is homosexual. Rachel is listening in on it and when he walks away, Quinn tells Rachel that she will never be able to take him. Rachel is confident and slightly cocky as she tells Quinn that she understands why she is so worried about her. She believes that she and Finn have bonded on a much more personal level than he ever could with Quinn. She tells her that she doesn't want or need to steal Finn because she has plenty of other options, however. 

At rehearsal, the kids are doing a routine to the song &quot;Le Freak&quot; and they aren't into it. Kurt says that the whole routine is just gay and that the song is, too. The other kids agree and Will tells them that they are performing it so they can recruit more Glee heads. After that, Will and Terri are looking for a house. They got into this position because Terri's sister thinks that they need much more space to live in with a child. Terri wants to build or buy a brand new house because she thinks that used homes aren't clean. Terri spent a while fawning over extra additions and then shows him what would be their child's room. He decides that he wants to do this for her and their future family. 

Will has been inspired and goes to tell the kids that they should do the song Gold Digger by Kanye West (and Jamie Foxx). They still would have to do Le Freak for the assembly, but he would like to work on Gold Digger, too. Finn thinks he has zero talent, but boy is he very, very wrong. Will helps him learn some steps and Finn takes to it quite a bit. 

Emma goes into the bathroom and she hears someone getting quite gaggy. It is Rachel and she is failing at trying to throw up. She realizes she must not have a gag reflex and Emma says that'll be very beneficial someday so not to worry. She also worries and decides that she and Rachel should probably talk. They go to her office and talk and she says she's not going to even bother trying throwing up anymore but she wishes she could be like Quinn...pretty and skinny. She feels so torn up over wanting Finn and all of her feelings. Emma tells her she should really work on finding some common ground with him. 

Later on, Finn and Rachel have been caught using Sue's printer to get some flyers printed for Glee. She has drug them and Will to the principals office and he decides that they are going to need to pay for the copies. She thought that they'd get into a world of trouble for it, but she was sorely disappointed. After that, Finn and Rachel ask Will to not have them perform the lame song &quot;Le Freak&quot;. For whatever reason, Will is thoroughly convinced that disco is very much in. Then he goes and asks to get a job doing late night janitorial work so he can make more money. He even gets the job by getting half the pay anyone else would get.

Rachel has joined the celibacy club and wonders where the boys are at. They seem to separate the sexes during celibacy club. Finn says that he only really joined so that he could sleep with Quinn. Most of the celibacy club is made up of the cheerleaders and they talk about how their skirts were designed. They like to tease, but not please.

It is now time so they all get together co-ed style and they are doing something called &quot;immaculate affection&quot;. This is when they have a balloon between a guy and a girl and if it pops then that causes the angels to cry. Rachel doesn't get it and thinks that celibacy is not all that possible when in high school. She thinks that they should all be prepared just in case and that girls are just as into sex as the guys.

Rachel decides that they are going to give the assembly some sex to entertain them. They decided to perform Push It instead of Le Freak and it was pretty hilarious. They get a standing ovation and Sue freaks out. She drags Will into the office and she says that he must get fired and Glee must be taken down. Instead of that, Figgins gives them songs that are approved and cuts the Cheerio's budget so they can get costumes for Glee club. 

Ken asks Emma out and tells her that he is willing to put up with all of her crazy and he wants to take care of her, too. She says she'll go on a date with him. She wants to do anything to stop thinking about Will. Finn and Rachel are working on a few things and then they eat. They begin to make out and Finn runs off after things get too hot for him to handle. He also asks that this be kept secret.

Terri has found out that she is not really pregnant. She had a fake pregnancy due to wanting to be pregnant so badly. Quinn and a couple of her cheerleaders have decided to audition for Glee. They tell Sue about it and she has officially enlisted them as her spies so they can tear Glee down. 

When Will gets home, she has made him dinner and tells him that they are having a boy and she wants him to quit his second job. She offers to just turn their extra room into a bedroom for the baby and she just wants to compromise instead of buying a giant house. The next day, Will tells Rachel that Quinn gets the lead on the song that they're performing and hopes that she has fun despite that.

  <Overview>Will forms an a capella group and spends more time with them than he does with New Directions after he is asked to perform at the PTA meeting with some surprising additions to his group. Meanwhile, Kurt is under pressure in his life which isn't helped by Mercedes' newfound interest in finding a relationship.

Recap:

In the beginning of the show, Will has invited his parents over to dinner. That is when they tell them that they are expecting and what they are expecting. They also say that they are working on the new nursery. When alone, Will tells his father that he doesn't think that he wants it and is worried about all of this baby stuff. His father feels bad about it and kind of takes the blame. His father tells him that to be a man is to have guts. Not only that, but Terri is absolutely ravenous trying to get pregnant so that her lie becomes the truth. 

Glee is not happy about Will's dance moves and they want to hire someone else. A really hardcore choreographer named Dakota Stanley. The cheerleaders are really working on knocking him down so that they can destroy Glee. Rachel has decided that she needs to talk to Will about what is going on with his choreography. She tells him that maybe he should get someone that will teach the dance movies. He's not into it and decides that he is going to have an acapella group with a couple of the guys from school. He starts it with the football coach, shop teacher, and another guy that doesn't work at the school. He happens to work where his wife Terri works. 

Sandy had been around when the Acafellas was being formed, but he is just creepy enough that he was certainly not accepted into the group. Besides, what was he doing there anyway? Sandy had been fired for touching a male student inappropriately but for whatever reason he was always around. In fact, there is a court order that says he needs to stay 50 feet away from the students. He tells them that he can get Josh Groban to check them out to see if the can be an opening act. They let him in the group based on that, but when Josh Groban does show up--Sandy gets another restraining order. Groban also tells the guys that this so called &quot;friendship&quot; was really him stalking him and being delusional in all kinds of way. He even sent him poetry, hair, gift baskets, and nude pictures! 

Despite Will's struggle between being a part of a group and being a teacher, he has come to the conclusion that he loves being a teacher more. His father also comes to the conclusion that he is going to just throw caution to the wind and finally go to law school like he really wanted to before his life got all out of wack. 

Glee has hired their own choreographer because Will isn't around. Finn says that maybe Will's confidence has been knocked down and no one really agrees or cares about what he has to say. Finn says that if people don't start taking him seriously, he is going to quit Glee. Mercedes is getting pretty sad that she is single. She has becoming closer to Kurt and knows she really shouldn't get closer in a different way, but somehow Quinn works her magic and convinces Mercedes otherwise. She decides to ask Kurt out and he wants her to go to Liza night. Rachel and Tina try to convince Mercedes that Kurt is actually gay, but she just doesn't want to be lonely anymore. 

She calls Kurt out on it and he says that he is in love with someone already. She thinks that he is talking about Rachel for whatever reason even though he's obviously into Finn. He breaks her heart and events fold from there. She even smashed his windshield. He comes out to her and lets her know that he didn't want to hurt her, but he is very much gay and doesn't want to lie anymore. He was a bit fenced for a bit, wishing he could turn around and slam the closet door but he was strong enough not to turn back from it.

Elsewhere, Puck has decided that he is tired of the high school fish and wants to be used strictly as some sort of a pool boy. He wants to find some older women to sleep with by cleaning pools in the area--which is few and far between. He is tired of the girls who care about who they are going to marry more than getting some. 

Back to the choreographer, though. Since Quinn has hired the most awful, mean choreographer on purpose things have been crazy. She had been enlisted by Sue to get them taken down while Will was concentrating on his own thing and pretty much neglecting glee. Stanley asks for quite a bit of money--money they don't have so hopefully they get rid of him soon for their sake. During the car wash that they had, Rachel eventually had enough of the abuse and decided to fired him. She feels they can win no matter what because they have what it takes. She also says that they are all very much special. It is good that she has faith in her group. 

Two of the Acafellas have left already so now they have Finn and Puck joining to fill in the spots. Puck joins because he wants to get some MILFs and Finn is convinced somehow despite wanting to quit Glee. Will teaches them the moves necessary for the performances. 

At the end of the show, Sue is completely angry with the cheerleaders and calls them a disaster. She decides that she is going to take away their privileges to tanning for that semester. Quinn tells her that she learned the best lesson she could and that it is not necessary to bring people down when you really believe in yourself.

  <Overview>Kurt joins the football team just to impress his father. Finn and Quinn's relationship gets a shocking development.

Recap:

In the opening of the show, they show Kurt, Tina, and Britney doing the dance to Single Ladies. They are all dressed up much like the video and they are doing a pretty great job. While they are doing this, Kurt's father Burt comes home and turns off the stereo. He has come home from work pretty early and asks what Kurt is wearing. He tells him that he is wearing a unitard and he says that the guys wear them for football. Britney tells his father that Kurt is now on the football team, which is very much not true. She tells him that he is also the kicker. Kurt tells him that Tina and Britney were helping him out with the whole work out thing. His father asks him who his girlfriend is and Kurt smacks Tina on the butt. He also tells him that he just doesn't want to settle down, yet. His father asks to keep the music down and to get him a ticket so he can see him play football.

Terri and Will are dealing the lamaze exercising. He helps her while her sister looks on and drinks some wine. She wants Will to toughen up because dealing with a pregnancy isn't meant for the weak, passive man. When they finally get Will out of the room to make food, Terri goes into panic mode and says that she can't keep it up. Kendra thinks that she really is pregnant and tells her to calm down because it is not as scary as it sounds. Terri asks her if she can keep a secret and then shows her stomach to her. She says that she can't tell him that it is fake and she is really scared that she is going to lose him. She thinks she should be honest, though. Kendra tells her to keep lying and chill out and that they are going to need to concentrate on getting a baby.

The next day, Will goes to the lounge for some lunch. His only real option is to sit with Ken and Emma. Which of course is weird, but it is better than his other option which is sitting with someone that may be creepier than the boogie man. He sits with them and Emma talks to him about how much she loves the news due to it being a lot like scary movies. She goes on to talk about it and then says that Sue has a segment on the local news. She told Ken and Will about her topic for the week which was caning kids and why it is for the best to do so. Will is perplexed by her even having a segment. 

During Glee, Will is passing out some music to the kids. Rachel realizes that the music is supposedly in the wrong key. He has given her a different spot to sing in--and Tina is the head. Rachel is upset by this because she said that no matter what happens if there is a West Side Story song then the solo goes to her. Rachel is thrown into a hissy fit and leaves because things aren't going her way. She was even quite rude to Tina saying that she is not ready to sing what Maria from the movie sang. Too bad Natalie Wood didn't sing the song from the movie either but hey--Rachel is a teenager.

Kurt talks to Finn and tells him that he has to ask him something. Finn says that he has a date to the problem already but he's flattered. Kurt says that he isn't gay and asks him for a favor. They go to the field and the team is awful, he has gotten Kurt on the team though. Puck asks Finn why he is even joining the team and if they're an item. He's not pleased at all that he wants to join the team.

Ken tells the team that they have not done well at all. He demotes the kicker to water boy and says that whoever can do it better gets position. Kurt goes up and says he's &quot;auditioning&quot; for the kicker. He tries out and he does an amazing kick so now he is on the team. Elsewhere, Sue is signing portraits and the man from the station walks in to give her fan mail and warns that there is hate mail, too. He then tells her that she can only have the segment if the cheerleaders win nationals. 

Finn and Quinn catch up in the hallway and he is wondering why she has been ignoring him lately. He apologizes to her not that there is a reason and then she finally tells him that she is pregnant. She tells him that the baby is his--even though he is a virgin. She reminds him that he had an &quot;early release&quot; that &quot;one time&quot; in the hot tub. He still doesn't think that is possible, but soon enough she convinces him that she is pregnant with his child. 

For whatever reason Sue is visiting Sandy Ryerson. He collects dolls and has been for fifty years. He then asks why she is even there and she says she just wanted to stop by. She tells him that she wants him to run the arts program at the school. He doesn't think the principal will approve, but she is going to handle it the way she always does. She decides that she is going to blackmail the principal and it kind of works. Sandy is hired and Sue tells him that she wants him to destroy Glee. She sets up a play for Cabaret to get Rachel away from the club. She goes out for the lead and gets it. Will is upset that Figgins has hired Sandy. 

Will goes to speak to Rachel and wonders why she left. She said she isn't leaving, she's just finding other outlets. He says she did all of this out of spite and she tells him he needs to admit that he doesn't like her. He tells her that it is quite the opposite as he can be her biggest fan most of them. He tells her that he needs to make everyone feel good in Glee, not just her. She can't just be the only star. 

Finn shows up and starts to cry and Will hugs him. Will decides to take him out for some dinner. He has told her about how Quinn is pregnant. Finn worries that he will end up trapped just like the other guys in town. Finn also asks Will to teach the team how to dance. He agrees to it. 

Back at the locker room, Finn has told the guys about the dance lessons. Puck isn't pleased at all. The coach is for it so they get all dressed up in their uniforms and go to the rehearsal room. Kurt has taught them the dance routine in the most basic way. After that, Puck wants to know what is up with Finn and he tells him that Quinn is pregnant. Finn goes elsewhere and Puck looks worried. 

The next morning, Puck confronts Quinn asking her what is up. He tells her that he's put two and two together and it is pretty weird that she'd say the baby is Finn's. He tells her that he'll help take care of the kid and she eventually snaps on him calling him a Lima loser. She goes to her car and Terri is in there waiting for her. She asks her how many weeks she is and then asks if she told her parents yet. She asks who she is and she says that she wants to help. Quinn says she doesn't need help and Terri tries to convince her that she does. 

At the football game, everyone shows up and gets ready for it to start. Finn tries to pump the guys up but they don't want to dance during the game. They don't play well and eventually they do the dance and then they win the game. At home, Burt goes down to talk to Kurt. He tells him he is proud of him and then Kurt tells him that he doesn't want to lie to him anymore and comes out to him as gay. He expects a horrible reaction, but his father tells him that he loves him just the same.

  <Overview>Mr. Schuester is concerned that the girls in the glee club are being disrespected and bullied by the guys. Looking to Madonna and her musical message of equality as inspiration, he challenges the entire team to choose Madonna songs as their next assignment in the hopes that the girls embrace her strength, independence and confidence and that the guys will see the error of their misogynistic ways. The glee club takes the assignment to heart as they perform some of Madonna’s greatest hits, including “Express Yourself” and “Like A Prayer.” Meanwhile, Kurt and Mercedes give Sue a vote of confidence with a makeover that is definitely in “Vogue”.</Overview>

  <Overview>In the wake of Kurt’s departure, Blaine tries to distract from his loneliness by entering the race for Senior Class President. The move puts him in direct conflict with Brittany who looks to repeat for a second term. After struggling to come up with fresh ideas for New Directions, Will begins to fear that he’s losing his enthusiasm for show choir. When an opportunity to reignite his passion and make a lasting positive impact on his students presents itself, the procrastinating Will gets prodding from two vastly different sources. After landing an internship with fashion icon Isabelle Klempt, Kurt comes up with an out-of-the-box idea to revitalize the fashionista’s sagging brand. While his initiative earns him a new mentor and earns Rachel a much needed makeover, his success also has a troublesome impact back in Lima.</Overview>
