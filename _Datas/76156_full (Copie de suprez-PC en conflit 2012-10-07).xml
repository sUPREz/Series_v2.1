  <Overview>Sunny, a new intern at Sacred Heart Hospital explains that she thought it would be fun to document her first year at the hospital with a video diary. She double majored in Pre-Med and Film at college, so she promises they won't be boring. Using freeze frames, she introduces herself and explains her nickname, Katie as possibly two-faced, Howie as snarky, Ed as always late, and Denise as her new Besty, but Denise comes off as kind of a bully.

In orientation, Ted tells the interns that lawsuits are bad and that they should never tell a patient if they make a mistake. Dr. Cox enters the orientation and tells the interns that it will not be a fun year for anybody, and when Sunny tells her camera she is still going to enjoy it, he confiscates her camera.

Later, Sunny tells the camera that a Janitor sold her her camera back, and pays The Worthless Peons to perform a theme song for her video diary. </Overview>

  <Overview>Sunny set up cameras around the classroom so her diary would be exciting. She is listening to Katie's and Denise's conversation about their sex lives. Katie finds it hard to be sexually active because of how busy she is at Sacred Heart. She then rejects Howie's offer. Denise states that she like guys with some meat on them because they &quot;try harder&quot;.

Dr. John Dorian enters the room, apologizes for having to leave, and continues giving a lesson about hospital vernacular. He explains many acronyms such as CTD (circling the drain), T.C.W. (tasty coma wife), &quot;gomer&quot; (get outta my emergency room), turfing and bouncing (send patients to other wards), LGFD (looks good from door) and HFFA (hot from far away). He then ends the lecture and leaves. Sunny finds a strange note which tells her &quot;Meeting in broom closet after lecture. Be there.&quot; which none of the other interns received. </Overview>

  <Overview>After Sunny received her mysterious note when she was in lecture with J.D., her and Howie, Denise and Katie visit the broom closet. There, a shelf slides away revealing a man sitting at a desk. The man is Janitor. He lays down some ground rules for their behavior at Sacred Heart. He tells them that they are not allowed to wrong him or enter Brain Trust headquarters. Janitor asks if anyone likes Dr. John Dorian, to which Katie says yes, and he kicks her out of his office.

Ted enters and notifies Janitor that his next appointment - a man with a raccoon - has arrived. Janitor then kicks the interns out of his office. </Overview>

  <Overview>While Sunny tells us about her upcoming class with Dr. Turk, suddenly Jimmy comes into the room. And once again, he is touching everybody, everywhere. Denise actually enjoys the touching, Howie not so much. And Katie even kisses Jimmy.

After that, Sunny suddenly can't find her video camera anymore.

As it turns out, Jimmy has taken it from her, to film a fake talk show called The Jimmy the Orderly Show. In it, he impersonates the talk show host and several well known actors from TV and cinema.

Then, Sunny comes into the room, where Jimmy is, and sees, that he took her camery. But he says, that he only borrowed it for the Jimmy the Orderly Show. And since every Jimmy the Orderly Show ends in a dance off, Sunny and Jimmy began to dance. </Overview>

  <Overview>As Sunny busily works in the ward at Sacred Heart, she tells the audience that she captured some secret footage of a Brain Trust meeting.

At the meeting, Janitor calls the meeting to order with a hammer as a gavel. He explains that Doug is not present because he may have looked at Janitor wrong. Janitor denies Todd's motion to date Sunny, and also denies his motion to go shirtless for the rest of the meeting. Ted is upset because it is very hot in the meeting. Janitor states that Sunny's cameras are not only important because they will capture the Brain Trust so children can later learn from it, but also so she can make Legal Custodians, a sitcom featuring Janitor and Ted as parents. Todd wants to be in the series, but Janitor tells him that they will just CGI in a child later.

They record the theme sequence, but when it comes time to shoot the pilot, Janitor tells Sunny to write the script. Sunny tells the viewers that next week will feature the pilot episode of Legal Custodians. </Overview>

  <Overview>Sunny can't help but sing the theme song to Legal Custodians as she introduces some outtakes for the new series.

In the outtakes, Janitor argues with Ted who can't seem to remember any of his lines. Ted also complains about his sweater being very itchy, and tries to take it off, but the Janitor won't let him. The Janitor also quizzes Ted as to what &quot;jump the shark&quot; means, and he can't answer. Ted also explains that he has never had to memorize a closing statement for a court case before. In the end, Ted can't stand his sweater anymore and ends up pulling it over his face, running into a wall, and falling to the ground.

At the same time, Todd hides behind the couch and the counter holding the &quot;child&quot; in the sitcom. </Overview>

  <Overview>After promising to buy him a cup of coffee, Sunny sits down with Dr. Kelso in Coffee Bucks so he can give her some final advice as an intern. He yells at her when she doesn't want to buy him a coffee because he is already drinking one, and he eventually begins telling her advice anyway. He tells her that she must always be on time, always have a weak friend to blame her problems on, and always keep secrets about rendezvous in the on-call room.

As Sunny states that she has to give the camcorder to her sister so she can record her ugly baby, she shows clips of Ed, Denise, Katie, and Howie remembering the advice they learned around the hospital.</Overview>

  <Overview>John Dorian, &quot;J.D.&quot; to friends, is a boyishly handsome, self-deprecatingly funny, likeable guy who would be confident if he only realized his assets. Four years of medical school have prepared J.D. for his first day as an intern at Sacred Heart Hospital - but he has his doubts. As J.D. is thrown into the chaotic world of hospital life, we not only get to see the quirky characters that he encounters, but also hear the humorous commentary of thoughts streaming through J.D.'s head. By J.D.'s side is his best friend since college, the handsome and confident Chris Turk. As a new surgical intern, Turk struts around with a gregarious and cocky demeanor that hides a terror that he only admits to J.D. Both guys initially have the hots for their attractive fellow intern, Elliot Reid, but J.D. quickly finds out her beauty is only surpassed by her hyper-competitive attitude. Guiding the interns' education are those with more medical experience. Dr. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Kelso, Chief of Medicine, wants the interns to think they can count on him. On the other side of the personality spectrum is Dr. Percival &quot;Perry&quot; Cox, a steamroller of a man short on patience.

  <Overview>J.D. has a patient who's rude to him and the nurses and eventually dies from cancer. J.D. feels awful for not giving him his full attention and worries maybe he could have saved the guy if he was nicer to him.
Meanwhile, Elliot is convinced that Dr. Kelso is the one singing a song called &quot;Tuscaloosa Heart&quot; on a tape given to her by a patient who claims he went to college with Bob. And Dr. Cox finds himself trapped in a love square: He's falling in love with Kristen Murphy, his intern, just as his ex-wife reappears demanding sex – and there's also his crush on Carla.</Overview>

  <Overview>An assortment of moms and dads descend on their offspring at home and in the workplace. J.D.'s father is a gregarious yet lonely divorcee who's desperately trying to be just one of the guys. Elliot's folks, on the other hand, are a snooty couple whose pompous behavior dismays their daughter. Similarly rattled is Turk, unnerved by the bonding of his girlfriend, Carla, and his brassy mother. But the most vexatious parent by far is the janitor's dad.
