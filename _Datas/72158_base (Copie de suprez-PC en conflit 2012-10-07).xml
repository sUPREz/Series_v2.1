    <Overview>Except for basketball, Nathan and Lucas Scott have nothing in common, but their mutual father will forever connect their lives in ways they could never imagine. Their father, Dan Scott, chose to abandon Lucas and raise Nathan in his image – a life of luxury and Tree Hill High Ravens basketball. Lucas, on the other hand, was raised by his single mother, Karen, and shares Nathan’s love for hoops, but keeps his game to the river court park. However, when the Tree Hill High coach, Whitey Durham, is in need of another player, Lucas and Nathan’s lives are forever entwined as the brothers face off on the court where Lucas battles for a spot on the team.</Overview>
