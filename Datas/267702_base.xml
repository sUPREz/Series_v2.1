    <Overview>Almost Human is an action-packed police procedural set 35 years in the future, when police officers are partnered with highly evolved human-like androids.

 The year is 2048. Meet Detective John Kennex, a cop who survived one of the most catastrophic attacks ever made against the police department. After waking up from a 17-month coma, he can’t remember much — except that his partner was killed, he lost one of his legs and he is now outfitted with a highly sophisticated synthetic appendage.

 By mandate, every cop must partner with a robot. And despite his passionate aversion to androids, John is paired up with Dorian, a discontinued android with unexpected emotional responses. Although such responses were deemed flaws, it is in these &quot;flaws&quot; that John relates to Dorian most. After all, John is part-machine now, and Dorian is part-human. John and Dorian’s understanding of each other not only complements them, it connects them.
