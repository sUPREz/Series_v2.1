    <Overview>From Emmy Award-winner Dan Harmon comes &quot;Community&quot;, a smart comedy series about higher education â€“ and lower expectations. The student body at Greendale Community College is made up of high-school losers, newly divorced housewives, and old people who want to keep their minds active. Within these not-so-hallowed halls, Community focuses on a band of misfits, at the center of which is a fast-talkin' lawyer whose degree has been revoked, who form a study group and end up learning a lot more about themselves than they do about their course work.</Overview>
