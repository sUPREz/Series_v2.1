  <Overview>Recently, life hasn't been smooth sailing for 16-year-old Carrie Bradshaw – her mother just passed away, her rebellious younger sister Dorritt is acting out, and their father Tom is struggling to raise two teenage daughters alone. As Carrie begins the first day of her junior year, she can’t help but feel as though all eyes are on her, and a pity party from rival Donna LaDonna doesn't help the situation. Even when surrounded by her group of friends, Mouse, Maggie and Walt, Carrie feels as though her life should be heading in a different direction. The arrival of new guy Sebastian Kydd brings Carrie some excitement, but it isn't until she accepts an internship at a Manhattan law firm that things begin to fall into place. In the city, Carrie meets Larissa Loughlin, a free-spirited, outgoing style editor at Interview magazine, who introduces her to a world she’s only dreamt of.</Overview>
