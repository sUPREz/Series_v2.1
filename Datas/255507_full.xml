  <Overview>Although the planning for the heist is starting to come together, the men’s lives aren’t getting any easier.
John is riding high on his new-found confidence and sense of power. He is excited by the macho tasks involved in planning the heist and insists on learning to fire the guns. Kalpesh is happy to help but he wants one of his men, Riaz, to be allowed to look around the counting house.
Chris finds his mum increasingly difficult to handle as her drinking gets worse and she suffers bouts of confusion and paranoia. Gina is frustrated that Marcus is getting sidelined and tells him to demand more responsibility.
John gives Marcus the task of buying the masks for the heist, so Gina and Marcus go on a little trip to buy them.
