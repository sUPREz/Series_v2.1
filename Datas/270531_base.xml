    <Overview>Catherine Black is a world-famous neurologist at the state-of-the-art medical institution known as &quot;The Cube&quot;. Catherine is brilliant, beautiful, and at the top of her game, though she's hiding a secret of her own: she's bipolar. Each week, the doctors on staff attempt to unravel the mysteries of the brain and are constantly challenged by cases never-before-seen on television. The medical stories are moving, bizarre and a visual feast. The personal stories are riveting. The patients have rare, highly visual, often hallucinogenic and startling conditions, which weâ€™ll see through their eyes as Catherine diagnoses and treats them.</Overview>
