  <Overview>As the movie begins, a slow moving mostly gray haired crowd walk through a French town. These people are clean, combed, and casually dressed. Integration with society becomes the first issue that concerns the town politics. While the authorities monitor and record movements, habits, sociability, and intelligence the personal relationships between the returned and their respective live spouses and parents comes into the foreground. Painful memories are awakened, guilt, fear, love, even unearthed passions are aroused. However, monitoring the returnees shows them to be very much apart from their live cohabitants and in fact involved in late night clandestine meetings, seemingly plotting with more intelligence than they are exhibiting in their day jobs.</Overview>

  <Overview>In a small mountain community, two local people - Camille, a teenager, and Simon - who both died years earlier, suddenly re-appear at their homes. They have not aged, and they are completely unaware of their own deaths. Camille and Simon assume they can rejoin the world of the living as though nothing has happened, but their return throws their friends and family into a state of turmoil. Camille's sister Léna has continued to grow up without her sibling beside her, and Simon's wife Adèle is just about to get remarried, to Thomas. Meanwhile, lonely nurse Julie receives a visit from a very strange little boy. Seven years ago, the town was struck by a series of bloody murders. Now it seems the killings have started up again.

  <Overview>Determined to come out of hiding and return to something resembling normal life, Camille invents a new identity for herself as 'cousin Alice'. Her sister Léna finds a strange, fast-spreading scar on her own body. Simon gets closer to Adèle, who finally accepts he has returned and is not a manifestation of her grief. But as the dead try to reclaim their lives, for the living, things seem more and more disturbed. Julie's very dark past resurfaces and threatens to destroy her completely, but she finds a saviour in the most unlikely form.</Overview>

  <Overview>Camille's new identity as Alice is going well, but Léna's scar is growing and seemingly draining her of energy.

  <Overview>Camille finds purpose when she decides to invent images of an afterlife to comfort her friend's parents, but is distraught when they commit suicide in the hopes of meeting their son sooner. Pierre shows Claire his shelter stocked with food and firearms, believing that the appearance of the Revenants marks the end of days. Lucy appears to have gained understanding regarding the purpose of the Revenants, and persuades Simon that he no longer needs Adèle; father Jean-François' betrayal of him to the police only pushes him further to her. Serge and Toni attempt to track Lena, and Toni glimpses his deceased mother in the forest. While trying to cross the lake by swimming, Serge disappears under the water.</Overview>

  <Overview>A flashback to the date of Camille's reappearance at the dam shows many Revenants also appearing at the same time. Waking in their car, Victor tells Julie and Laure that a group of Revenants tried to take him from the car in the middle of the night. On their way to the shelter, Victor discovers that Toni killed his brother, in turn causing his mother's death, and uses his ability to create visions to make Toni shoot himself in the stomach; he dies shortly after arrival. Simon breaks free from his jail cell and kidnaps his daughter, Chloé. Thomas arrives at the shelter, and the group realise that there are other Revenants, and that they are coming for them.</Overview>
