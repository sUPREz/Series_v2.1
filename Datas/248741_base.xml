    <Overview>A lot of girls move to New York City to &quot;make it&quot;. Max and Caroline are just trying to make their rent. In this fun, outrageous comedy series, two girls from very different backgrounds – Max, poor from birth, and Caroline, born wealthy but down on her luck – wind up as waitresses in the same colorful Brooklyn diner and strike up an unlikely friendship that could lead to a successful business venture. All they need to do is come up with $250,000 in start-up expenses. &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot; infuses the classic comedy with something new, current and young, proving life can be fun – even if you’re broke.</Overview>
